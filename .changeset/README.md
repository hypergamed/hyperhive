# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## Adding a Changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Releasing

When changesets are merged to main, the release workflow will:

1. Create a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps
2. When merged, publish packages to npm

## More Information

See [the changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for more details.
